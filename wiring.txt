BLDC controller wiring for ATmega8
---------------------------------

- **Hall sensors**:
  - Hall sensor A -> PC1
  - Hall sensor B -> PC2
  - Hall sensor C -> PC3
  Use pull-up resistors (or enable internal pull-ups).

- **Throttle potentiometer**:
  - Connect wiper to PC0 (ADC0).
  - Connect ends to VCC and GND.

- **Power MOSFET gate drivers**:
  - Phase A high side gate -> PD2
  - Phase A low side gate (PWM) -> PB1 (OC1A)
  - Phase B high side gate -> PD3
  - Phase B low side gate (PWM) -> PB2 (OC1B)
  - Phase C high side gate -> PD4
  - Phase C low side gate (PWM) -> PD5 (OC0)

High-side outputs are switched fully on or off.
Low-side outputs use PWM generated by Timer0/1 to control motor speed.
Make sure the MOSFET drivers share common ground with the ATmega8.
